Upload Database on EC2

Step 1: Firstly rename the created EC2 instances

    1) DB-Instance
    2) Backend-Instance
    3) UI-Instance
    
    Steps to rename the EC2 instance:
    
    Copy the instance ID of the instance that you want to rename.

    Use the command to rename the instance,
        > aws ec2 create-tags --resources [instance-id] --tags Key=Name,Value=[new-name]
    replacing [instance-id] with the instance ID you copied and [new-name] with the new name you want for the instance.

    Verify that the instance has been renamed by typing the command 
        > aws ec2 describe-instances
    
    
Step 2: 
    1) Download the given SSH key to the local machine
    2) Write the below command we get after creating the instance
        ssh -i "Keypair.pem" ubuntu@EC2-IP.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
       replace the EC2-IP line by the actual IP address of the given EC2 instances

       
Step 3:
    1) Install the MySQL server.
        > $ sudo apt-get install mysql-client
    2) Configure the MySQL server to accept remote connections.
    3) Connect to your MySQL Database:
            > $ mysql -h <hostname> -u <username> -p
        4) Enter the password for the user when prompted and you should be connected to the MySQL server.
        5) Try to access the database from DBeaver on PORT:3306 from local
           Try to see the existing databases by using 
               > show databases;
           Try to create schema using 
               > create schema AirGP;
           If schema is created succesfully then we can say that, MySql is successfully installed on EC2
    6) Test the connection and begin using your database.
